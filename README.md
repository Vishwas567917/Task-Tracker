# Responsive Task Tracker

The Responsive Task Tracker is a simple task management application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. It is designed to be responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices. The application uses local storage to save tasks, allowing users to retain their task list even after refreshing or closing the browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Add new tasks to the list with a simple text input and "Add Task" button.
- **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them. Completed tasks are styled with a line-through and gray text.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list with a "Delete" button.
- **Local Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist across sessions.
- **Responsive Design:** Adjusts layout and styling for smaller screens and mobile devices.

## Project Structure

- **HTML:** Defines the structure of the task tracker.
